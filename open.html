   ·°£ê≠©‚Ä¢,,~`¬∞‚Ä¢ Hello my love, This is a pre Valentines Day letter for you. 

Regarding what happened earlier, I still kind of feel drained to do anything.
But that isn't stopping me though>:P

Anyways, First of all, Apologies, My sincerest apologies.
I just find it so hard to stop assuming but I am trying to be better.
As I said prior to this message, I felt really sad when you said I was disturbing you, I really rhought my life was crumbling again, Just like how it did back then, But it's new with you, You actually came back to me. And thats a first. I'm just so grateful you care and actually try to fix things. I can't thank you enough. So yeah, I do hope that none of us are going to back out of our future relationship (Hopefully.) I really do see us being together and it's just wonderful.

Second of all, Thank you Thank you Thank you!!#%@%!

I feel so blessed to have you, cherub. You are an absolute blessing and a gift to me. Though things between our own personal issues aren't that fixed yet, I'm glad that we are there for each other to try and mend things together. (Man, look at us fixing things like an actual couple)  So yeah, I'm so happy you exist, Thanks to our almighty God :))
Your personality stands out to me and I'm so glad you were raised properly. Thank you for giving me the love that I never knew I'd still receive.

Lastly, My thoughts.

Have you ever felt like you want someone to do something for you but you just want them to do it naturally so you never end up telling them? Yeah, that's me right now.
I don't know if its because of my crippling addicition to love stories and msa but I really want you, yes you, to do things for me secretly, yes it's a lot to ask for but that's all i really want to be honest, No need for expensive gifts and money, I just want gifts that you actually spent effort on and giving some time off your day just for me (i sound so selfish but i need to get this out my head)
Like for example, i'd always anticipate you sending me a letter when you don't look at my messages for a long time or even the time you're offline for hours or a day and another example is when I really wanted you to pat my head during times I'm not looking but yeah I understand that you don't feel comfortable doing it in public:>

So yeah that's all, I'm so glad to have you but i suggest that we dont get attached to each other that much because the more we get attached the more itll hurt in the future, which we dont know how our relationship will end up.
Anyways, I hope you're feeling great and have eaten well.

Sooooo thats all
(Edit I was about to send but you chatted)

Anyways yesh I looooooooooooooooovvvvvveeeeeeee yyooooooooouuuuuuuuuu ‚ù§Ô∏é

    <h1>SHORT LETTER SHORT LETTER SHORT LETTER SHORT LETTERSHORT</h1>
    <p>Heyooo! I'm writing this at 1:43 PM, hehe I love you pm ;p but I'll always love you any time any day:3
      I just want to say thank you for loving me, I really can't thank you enough bruv, As a hopeless romantic all throughout
      my life, I never thought that I would have someone as great as you, Like seriously, You can have anyone you want to have a crush with
      and out of all the prettier, smarter and kinder girls around us, you chose to like me, And I still find that so hard to believe,
      I know that you were struggling on adjusting here and I just so happened to chat you then overtime I guess it came out naturally
      so yeah I'm just gonna yap about what I want to do with you in the future, SO. Dates. Coffee dates, picnic dates,
      Library dates, ANYTHINGGGFSEBUFSI, I really want to go on cute picnics with you and maybe feed you some strawberries.
      Also, this is just a shrot letter, nothing like those I've sent that are usually made when I'm deeply locked in.
      Also I just want to tell you something, I know that it's really early for us to start liking each other given that we only knew
      each other for 7 months, I want to take things slow and get to know you better, and maybe give it a year, I don't want
      it to be a sort of love bombed relationship so yeah, if you're reading this, I hope you understand and we can talk. :)
      so yeah, I wanna talk to you more and I look forward to more interactions and conversations with you, just know that
      you really helped me when I was at my lowest and I am so glad I did the same to you, I love you. I really do. I love you
      more than my passion for art, I love you more than coding, I love you more than you could love yourself (which you should do),
      I love you perpetually, You will forever hold a special place in my heart, I am more than willing to give you everything
      I have just so you can feel loved, which I cannot do properly, I love you so much it hurts, It hurts me to love you
      because of my past, But you're slowly cutting that thread of my regrets and guilt, you're stopping the wheel of my life
      cycle, you're..everything I need. I love you, No, I ADORE eveyr single bit and part of you, from your heart to your soul,
      I love you so much. I love you. Happy Valentines Day, my beau.
